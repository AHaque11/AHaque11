### Hi, I'm Arefa 🖐

I'm a CS student who recently began taking programming courses. So far, I've worked with C# to create Windows forms programs and have started my first C++ course. I hope to use GitHub to help expand my knowledge of programming languages and gain experience contributing to projects.
