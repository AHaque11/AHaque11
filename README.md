### Hi, I'm Arefa 🖐

I'm a CS student who recently began taking programming courses. So far, I've worked with C# and have started my first C++ course. I hope to use GitHub to help expand my knowledge of programming languages and gain experience contributing to projects.



A hobby of mine: check out my Youtube channel if you're interested in flamenco/Spanish translation: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ScLnGpccdi73kbWXxXcAg/videos 💃💃
