### Hi, I'm Arefa 🖐

I'm currently an undergrad CS student. As soon as I've finished the required courses, I plan to apply to the Master's program in Computer Science at Wayne State University. So far, I've worked with C#, C++, and Java, and I've developed a good understanding of data structures. I hope to use GitHub to help expand my knowledge of programming languages and gain experience contributing to projects.
