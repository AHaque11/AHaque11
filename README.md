### Hi, I'm Arefa 🖐

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Wayne State University. I am proficient in C, C++, and Java, and I've developed a good understanding of data structures and multithreaded programming. I hope to use GitHub to help expand my knowledge of programming languages and gain experience contributing to projects.
